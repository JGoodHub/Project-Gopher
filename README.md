# Project-Gopher

A project for the Hathora Multiplayer-Madness game jam (https://itch.io/jam/multiplayer-madness-by-hathora)

The intention was to play a gopher character that is slowed by chains. You could throw the chains at other players to slow or stun them. The objective was to balance needing chains or slowing others based on the objectives around.

Unfortunately we did not submit the project, but we made great progress considering 3 out of 4 of us were new to Unity. We set up a functioning arena, player, chain, and stun system and made progress into the network code and deploying the game to Hathora.

## Controls

W A S D - Move the gopher
